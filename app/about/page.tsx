            AI Quiz is a modern studying companion that uses the power of OpenAI
            to turn any PDF into a personalized quiz. Whether you&apos;re
            reading lecture slides, eBooks, academic papers, or training
            manuals, simply upload your file and let the app generate
            multiple-choice questions that challenge your understanding of the
            material. Each question comes with clear answer choices, correct
            answers, and brief explanations to reinforce learning.

            even to gamify your study sessions. It&apos;s fast, easy to use, and
            adapts to any subject matter â€” turning passive reading into active
            learning.
